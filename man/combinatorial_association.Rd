\arguments{
\item{ps}{A phyloseq object containing the taxa counts.}

\item{variable}{The factor variable to permute.}

\item{tax}{The taxa level on which to run differential tests. Defaults to
genus.}

\item{confounders}{A character vector containing the confounders that should
be used.}

\item{min_abundance}{Minimum required number of average counts for a taxa.}

\item{in_samples}{Taxa must be present in at least this fraction of samples.}

\item{independent_weighting}{Whether to adjust p values by independent
weighting or normal Benjamini-Hochberg.
factors.}

\item{standardize}{Whether to standardize continuous variables to a mean
of zero and a variance of 1. If True log fold changes for those variables
denote are relative to a change of one standard deviation in the variable
value.}

\item{shrink}{Whether to return shrunken log fold changes. Defaults to true.}
