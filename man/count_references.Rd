\title{Count alignment hits to a reference database.}
\usage{
count_references(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An experiment data table as returned by any alignment method
like \code{\link{align_short_reads}} or \code{\link{align_long_reads}}.}

\item{...}{A configuration as generated by \code{\link{config_count}}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the used alignments and the transcript counts in
 `counts`.
}
\description{
This will correct for effective reference lengths as done by almost any
good tool those days. So the returned counts are not correlated with
feature lengths. By default an expectation maximization algorithm is
used to resolve multiple mappings of one read to many references which
pretty much always happens in metagenomics data sets. The optimized
likelihood function is very similar to the one in kallisto
(https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3519).
}
\details{
Note that for the EM method there will be a NA reference reported which
corresponds to the approximate abundance of references not contained in the
database.
